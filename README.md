# MEGA Voltex
An Arduino Mega 2560 Sound Voltex controller shield for use with [ACreal_IO](https://github.com/Nadeflore/ACreal_IO).

This is still SUPER early days. The plan is to solder components to this shield, desolder the USB connector & power connector from an Arduino Mega 2560, slap this bad boy on top of it, and design a 3D printed enclosure for it.

- [KiCad's footprints](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-footprints) - I modified a couple of their SW_Cherry MX1A footprints to add LED through-holes. I plan on submitting a PR upstream for this.
